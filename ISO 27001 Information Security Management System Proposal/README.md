In this project, I developed an Information Security Management System (ISMS) proposal to help SecureTech Solutions close key gaps in alignment with ISO/IEC 27001 standards. The proposal focused on strengthening access controls, incident response, and data backup procedures to improve the organization’s security maturity and compliance posture.

Key Responsibilities:

Identified critical compliance gaps, including:
- Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive system access.
- Absence of centralized incident logging and monitoring.
- Infrequent backup routines risking data loss.




Mapped each gap to relevant ISO 27001 controls:
- A.9 Access Control
- A.16 Incident Response
- A.12 Operations Security




Recommended and planned control implementations, including:
- MFA deployment and training for privileged accounts.
- SIEM integration for centralized logging and alerting.
- Automation of daily incremental backups and monthly recovery testing.




Developed a practical 1–3 month timeline for implementation with resource and monitoring requirements for each control.
