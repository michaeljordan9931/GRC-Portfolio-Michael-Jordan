Project Summary: Governance Charter Review and Recommendations



I reviewed SecureTech’s current governance charter, focusing on the mission, objectives, and
defined roles and responsibilities of the GRC team. Based on Scenario 2—a recent audit finding
that identified slow data breach response times due to unclear roles in the incident response
process—I recommended targeted updates to the charter. These updates focused on clarifying
responsibilities within the incident response workflow, assigning specific roles for breach
detection, communication, and containment, and improving overall response coordination to
ensure faster and more effective incident handling.
