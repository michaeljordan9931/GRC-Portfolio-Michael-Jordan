Project Summary: ISO 27001 Audit Findings and Compliance Recommendations



After reviewing SecureTech’s internal audit results, I analyzed each compliance gap against ISO
27001 requirements and compiled a detailed Compliance Gap Report for the leadership team.
In the report, I highlighted the most critical issues, explained the associated risks, and provided
prioritized actionable recommendations to mitigate those risks. The overall focus was on
restoring compliance, strengthening security controls, and enhancing SecureTech’s information
security governance to reduce organizational exposure to potential threats.
