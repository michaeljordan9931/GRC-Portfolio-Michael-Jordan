Project Summary: Phishing Risk Assessment for SecureTech


I completed a risk assessment for a recent phishing attempt that targeted employees in
SecureTech’s Finance Department. The phishing email contained a malicious link with the
potential to expose sensitive financial information and allow unauthorized access to internal
systems. I evaluated the likelihood of the phishing attempt leading to a breach—considering
that the attack was detected but not all employees were aware before interacting with it. I also
assessed the potential impact of a successful breach. Based on this evaluation, I rated both
the likelihood and impact levels and documented the results in the risk matrix for review.
