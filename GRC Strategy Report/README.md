Project Summary: Comprehensive GRC Strategy for DataServe Solutions



I developed a comprehensive GRC strategy for SecureTech’s new client, DataServe Solutions,
to address their multi-jurisdictional compliance needs with frameworks such as PCI DSS,
GDPR, and CCPA. The project began with outlining governance structures, assigning roles and
responsibilities, establishing a policy framework for key areas like data privacy and risk
management, and defining escalation paths for incident response and compliance
decision-making. The strategy was tailored to support the client’s risk management, regulatory
compliance, and business objectives.
