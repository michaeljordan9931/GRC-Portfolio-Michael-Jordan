As part of my role on SecureTech Solutionsâ€™ GRC team, I conducted a formal PCI DSS on-site assessment and completed an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) for the organization as a service provider. This project focused on evaluating compliance with PCI DSS requirements across the cardholder data environment (CDE), including network infrastructure, encryption key management, and user access control systems.

Key Responsibilities:

Assessed six core PCI DSS domains, including firewall configuration, cardholder data encryption, vulnerability management, access controls, security testing, and policy enforcement.


Identified areas of non-compliance and recommended actionable remediation strategies for:

Delayed encryption key rotation (compensating controls were implemented temporarily).

Shared administrator accounts and incomplete MFA coverage.



Developed a remediation roadmap with milestones to achieve full compliance, including the transition to unique admin IDs and expanded MFA implementation.


Prepared official AOC documentation for SecureTech's leadership and PCI stakeholders.
