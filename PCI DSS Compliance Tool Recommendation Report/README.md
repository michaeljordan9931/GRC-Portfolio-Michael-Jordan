Project Summary: PCI DSS Compliance Tool Recommendation



As the GRC Analyst, I was tasked with selecting a compliance tool to help SecureTech meet
PCI DSS requirements for its newly onboarded financial industry clients. I focused on Scenario
2: Payment Processing Compliance and researched two leading compliance tools, comparing
their features, pricing, usability, and effectiveness. I then submitted a recommendation report to
my supervisor, Mark Taylor, justifying the selected tool based on its ability to support data
protection, secure payment processing, monitoring, and audit readiness.
