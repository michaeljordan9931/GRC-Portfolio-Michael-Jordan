Project Summary: PCI DSS Mock Audit Using SAP GRC


As part of SecureTech’s compliance team, I conducted a mock audit to assess the company’s
adherence to PCI DSS standards using SAP GRC. I reviewed key focus areas, including
security management, access controls, network security, vulnerability management, and
monitoring practices. During the audit, I evaluated access controls for cardholder data, data
protection methods such as encryption and masking, firewall and antivirus configurations, and
the effectiveness of the incident response plan. I documented areas of compliance, identified
vulnerabilities, and proposed remediation actions. The findings were compiled into a formal
compliance report for SecureTech’s leadership, including an executive summary, detailed audit
findings by PCI DSS requirement, targeted recommendations, and an overall assessment of the
organization's compliance posture.
