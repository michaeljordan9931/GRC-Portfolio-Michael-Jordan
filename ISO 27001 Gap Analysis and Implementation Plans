Project Summary: ISO 27001 Control Prioritization and Implementation Plan
Based on my gap analysis of SecureTech’s current security posture, I identified and prioritized the three most critical ISO 27001 controls requiring immediate implementation. I justified the selection of these controls by assessing their potential risk and impact on the organization. For each control, I developed a detailed implementation plan outlining specific action steps, a timeline, required resources (including personnel, technology, and budget), and a method for monitoring the effectiveness of each control after implementation. The goal was to close key compliance gaps, strengthen SecureTech’s information security framework, and reduce the organization’s exposure to threats.
